/* The .Z file format.

   The ".Z" file format consists of the three bytes 1f 9d 90, followed
   by a logical bitstream. The logical bitstream is encoded as a
   physical byte stream in the little endian sense, i.e. the first bit
   of the bit stream is encoded as the least significant bit of the
   first byte. At the end, the bitstream is padded with 0 bits to a
   byte boundary.

   The logical bit stream in turns represents a logical stream of
   integers of varying bit length. These integers are represented in
   the little-endian way, i.e., the first bit of the bitstream
   represents the least significant bit of the first integer, etc. In
   this way, the bit stream is interpreted as a sequence of: A1 9-bit
   integers, followed by A2 10-bit integers, followed by A3 11-bit
   integers, followed by A4 12-bit integers. It is possible for a
   stream to encode fewer integers than this, but the maximal number
   is A1+A2+A3+A4. The meaning of these integers is of no particular
   concern here.
   
   The Postscript level 2 compressed stream format

   The Postscript level 2 compressed stream format consists of a
   logical bitstream. This bitstream is encoded as a byte stream in
   the big endian sense, i.e., the first bit of the bit stream is
   encoded as the most significant bit of the first byte. 

   The Postscript level 2 bitstream represents an abstract stream of
   integers of varying number of bits. These integers are represented
   in the big-endian sense, i.e. the first bit of the bit stream is
   the most significant bit of the first integer. 

   The bit stream is interpreted in this way as the 9-bit integer 256,
   followed by one or more blocks of integers, each of which consist
   of at most B1 9-bit integers, followed by B2 10-bit integers,
   followed by B3 11-bit integers, followed by B4 12-bit integers.
   The last integer in each block is 256 or 257; it is 257 in the last
   block, and 256 in every other block. Each block may contain fewer
   than B1+B2+B3+B4 integers. The integers 256 and 257 do not occur
   elsewhere.
   
   Relationship between the two integer streams.

   Divide the Postscript abstract integer stream into blocks by
   removing all occurrences of 256 and 257 and treating them as
   separators. In each block, decrement all the integers that are
   greater than 256 by 1. Now each block represents an integer stream
   in the ".Z" sense. Thus, multiple consecutive ".Z" streams of at
   most min(A1+A2+A3+A4, B1+B2+B3+B4) integers can be represented as a
   single Postscript stream.

   The translation from a sequence of ".Z" streams to a Postscript
   stream thus proceeds in a pipeline, roughly:

   bytestream -> bitstream -> integer stream -> integer stream ->
   bitstream -> bytestream.
