=====================
Gamera Vector toolkit
=====================

(c) 2005 Michael Droettboom

The Gamera vector toolkit adds basic functionality for manipulating
and analysing vector paths (as opposed to raster images).

There's not much here yet, but there general framework is there and
ready to be added to.

See the TODO file at the root of the source tree for what is missing
and needs to be done.
