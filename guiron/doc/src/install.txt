Building and installing the Guiron Toolkit
==========================================

Overview
====================

This document contains instructions on how to install the Guiron
Toolkit into Gamera's framework.  The Guiron Toolkit is used to add
fourier functionality to Gamera.

**Please make sure that Gamera is built and fully installed before
proceeding.**

Gamera can be downloaded at http://gamera.sourceforge.net/

General Installation
====================

The Guiron Toolkit is built and installed similarly to Gamera itself.  The
installation is built using the Python-standard Distutils system.  

Prerequisites
-------------

- Gamera_ 2.2x+ CVS Build (Version must have COMPLEX pixel type)
- FFTW_ 3.01 (Installed so your compiler may see it)

.. _Gamera: http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=99328
.. _FFTW: http://www.fftw.org/download.html


From a prompt type::

  python setup.py build
  sudo python setup.py install


Microsoft Windows Installation
==============================

Finding FFTW3, Installing, and Building Guiron
----------------------------------------------

Installation on Windows requires a precise handling of fftw3.  In order
to  get fftw3 visit http://www.fftw.org/install/windows.html. On this page,
there are two available FFTW 3.0.1 builds: one built with ICL7, and another
built with MinGW.  The one you should choose will depend on the compiler
with which you plan to build Guiron.

Once you have downloaded the distribution of FFTW that best suits your needs,
unzip the file. The resulting directory will contain an fftw3.dll file. Place the file in::

  [startup disk]:\WINDOWS\System32


This installs the fftw shared library onto your system. The next step is to
copy the fftw3.lib (if you downloaded the ICL build) or fftw3.def (if you
got the MinGW build) into the Guiron source directory. This is to allow the
linker to find fftw-defined symbols and complete the Guiron build process.
Once you have placed these files, run setup.py (with build arguments as per
your needs) to invoke the building/installation process.


Running Guiron
==============

Within Gamera select the "Toolkits" menu (ctrl+t) to view a complete
selection of the toolkits installed within gamera.

Choose "guiron"-> "Import 'guiron' toolkit

Alternatively you may type:  from gamera.toolkits import guiron

If 'guiron' does not exist within the Toolkits menu or there is an error
during import, there was probably a problem with installation.  Please
reinstall, and email any problems you had to Robert Ferguson:
robert dot ferguson at jhu dot edu

Once running a new list of functions should appear under DFT.  Most of these
functions require COMPLEX images to work.


Building the documentation
==========================

Once the the toolkit is built, the documentation can be
generated and converted to HTML.

Prerequisites
-------------

Generating documentation requires two third-party Python
libraries:

  - docutils_ (version 0.3 or later) for handling reStructuredText documents.

  - SilverCity_ (version 0.9 or later) for colorizing source code.

.. _docutils: http://docutils.sourceforge.net/

.. _SilverCity: http://silvercity.sourceforge.net/



Generating
----------

To generate the documentation, go to the ``doc`` directory and run the
``gendoc.py`` script.

Alternatively, you can call the ``gendoc.py`` script with the
documentation directory as a commandline argument::

   gendoc.py -d /path/to/doc
