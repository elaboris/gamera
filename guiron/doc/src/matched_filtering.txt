Cross correlation is a method of estimating the correlation of two complex functions (basically by taking the complex conjugate). The DFT of the cross-correlation is called the cross spectrum and it is the more pertinent function for use in image processing.

   The template to correlate

This technique compares a template of the desired image (the correlation kernel) with the actual source image.  This generates a new image (the correlation image) that indicates where the template matches.

   The source image

*image*
   The template you wish to correlate
